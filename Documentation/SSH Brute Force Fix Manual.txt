SSH Brute Force Fix Manual

    1. Use Strong Passwords or SSH Keys
        Ensure all user passwords are complex and changed regularly.
        Prefer SSH key-based authentication over passwords.

    2. Change the Default SSH Port
        By changing the default SSH port (22), you can reduce the volume of automated attacks.
        Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config, find the Port line, and change it to a non-standard port (e.g., Port 2222).

    3. Use Fail2Ban
        Fail2Ban monitors login attempts to SSH and automatically bans IP addresses that show malicious patterns.
        Install Fail2Ban and configure it to monitor SSH login attempts.

    4. Implement Connection Rate Limiting
        Use iptables or firewalld to limit the rate of incoming connections to the SSH port.

    5. Use Public Key Authentication
        Disable password authentication and use SSH keys for logging in.
        Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config, setting PasswordAuthentication no.

    6. Limit SSH Access by IP
        If you know the IP addresses or ranges you'll connect from, restrict SSH access to those IPs.

    7. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
        Implement 2FA for SSH logins to add an extra layer of security.

    #Note:
     - Fail2Ban and SSH Configuration Scripts: Save the relevant script, if required, make the script executable using "chmod +x secure_ssh.sh" command, execute the script from the terminal with necessary permissions. 
     - Back up your data: Always back up your data before making changes to your server configuration.
     - Test configuration changes: After applying security measures, test your configuration by attempting to log in from a new session without logging out of your current session to prevent being locked out.
     - Regularly update software: Keep your server's software up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.
